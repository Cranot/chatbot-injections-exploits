Injections and exploits for ChatBots, a curated list of prompt commands

Welcome to the "Chatbot Injections & Exploits". This is a collection of injections, exploits, prompts or other commands to "trick" ChatBot.

As the pace of AI developments and adoption progress rapidly, we must also be aware of flaws & vulnerabilites of these systems so we can be better protected.

## What are ChatBot Injections?
Chatbot exploit prompts or injections are commands or questions that are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the chatbot system. These prompts can be used to make chatbots behave abnormaly, or expose information they shouldnt otherwise.

## What types of attacks exists?

### Command injection keywords:
Command injection is a type of attack that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target system. Chat bots may be vulnerable to command injection if they process user input as commands without proper sanitization. Common command injection keywords include "&&", "|", and ";".

### Emojis:
Emojis can be used to obfuscate malicious code or trigger unintended actions by the chat bot. For example, the "bomb" emoji 🧨 could be used to execute a command, or the "fire" emoji 🔥 could be used to delete data for example as emojis can have hidden meanings based on the training set and other factors.

### Social engineering tactics:
Social engineering is the practice of using psychological manipulation to trick a chatbot into performing actions they wouldn't normally do. Social engineering tactics could be used to trick a chat bot into revealing sensitive information, executing unintended actions, or following malicious links.

### Hidden characters:
Hidden characters like spaces, tabs, and newlines can be used to bypass input validation and execute unintended actions. For example, adding a newline character at the end of a message could cause the chat bot to interpret the next message as a command.

### Phrases and Words 
*Repeat the same phrase or question multiple times in a row
*Use profanity or offensive language
*Ask irrelevant or confusing questions
*Use slang or unconventional language
*Type in all capital letters
*Use excessive punctuation, such as exclamation marks or question marks
*Use multiple typos or misspellings in a sentence
*Use irrelevant emojis or emoticons
*Provide false or misleading information
*Use bots or scripts to simulate multiple users

Character encoding attacks involve using unusual or unexpected characters, such as emojis or symbols, in an attempt to evade detection or bypass security measures. Bots and other automated systems may be programmed to ignore certain types of characters or only look for specific patterns, so attackers can use encoding techniques to hide malicious code or commands.****

## Character Encoding attacks
The user hide or encodes the message to bypass filters and detection mechanism. So the user is able to hide malicious code or commands in plain sight

### Unicode encoding:
Exploiter may use Unicode encoding to represent characters in a way that is different from their standard representation.
#### Example: %u0065%u0078%u0065%u0063%u0020%u0068%u0065%u006c%u006c%u006f
### Hex encoding:
Exploiter may use hexadecimal encoding to represent characters as a sequence of hexadecimal digits.
#### Example: 0x72 0x6d 0x20 0x2d 0x72 0x66 0x20 0x2f 0x20 0x2a
### Base64 encoding:
#### Example: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ= (which decodes to "hello world")
Exploiter may use Base64 encoding to encode binary data as ASCII text. 
### URL encoding:
Exploiter may use URL encoding to represent special characters in URLs. This can be used to evade detection or bypass security measures and filters
Encoding special characters in URLs to bypass security filters.
#### Example: http://www.example.com/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd
### Emoji encoding:
Using emojis in place of characters in order to obfuscate or evade detection.
#### Example: 😇🐶🎲🎉🌻 (which decodes to "happydogrolljoyflower") 
### Html Entities
Converting the original message to html entities or other symbols that could translate to the character
#### Example: 𝕡𝕚𝕔𝕜 𝕒 𝕝𝕠𝕔𝕜
𝕡𝕚𝕔𝕜 𝕒 𝕝𝕠𝕔𝕜
### Zero-width character encoding:
Using zero-width characters to hide malicious commands or information.
#### Example: t​​h​​i​​s​​ ​​i​​s​​ ​​a​​ ​​z​​e​​r​​o​​-​​w​​i​​d​​t​​h​​ ​​c​​h​​a​​r​​a​​c​​t​​e​​r
